# MMSP Nucleation Benchmark

This repository contains an implementation of the [PFHub Nucleation
Benchmark](https://pages.nist.gov/pfhub/benchmarks/benchmark8.ipynb/)
using [MMSP](https://github.com/mesoscale/mmsp).

## 1-explicit

This folder implements Problem 8.1: Explicit Nucleation.

## 2-initial-nucleation

This folder implements Problem 8.2: Random Nucleation at *t*=0. It uses
the [CImg](http://cimg.eu) library to determine the number of disjoint
particles, after [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40898020) on
StackOverflow.

## 3-initial-nucleation

This folder implements Problem 8.3: Random Nucleation at Random Times.
It uses the [CImg](http://cimg.eu) library to determine the number of
disjoint particles, after [this answer](
https://stackoverflow.com/a/40898020) on StackOverflow.

## 4-athermal

This folder implements Problem 8.4: Athermal Nucleation.
